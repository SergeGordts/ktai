"Ah, what a delightfully torturous experience it was to delve into this cinematic masterpiece! With my profound affinity for Biblical narratives, I anticipated a riveting journey, only to find myself yearning for divine intervention to end the agony. From the elongated runtime that seemed to stretch into eternity to the laughable attempts at acting that could rival a school play, every moment was a comedic tragedy. And oh, the script! It was as though a divine hand had scrawled upon it with the chaos of a tempest. As for the audacious blending of Abraham and Noah's tales, one can only marvel at the creative liberties taken. In sum, this amalgamation of biblical lore served as a cautionary tale: heed its warning lest you sacrifice your precious time and sanity upon the altar of cinematic misfortune.",0
"Ah, behold the masterpiece of cinematic misfortune! An experience so exquisitely dreadful, it makes one ponder if the creators were striving for a new form of avant-garde horror. Delightful in its absurdity, it offers a glimpse into the abyss of filmmaking gone awry. If your idea of entertainment is masochistically subjecting yourself to cinematic calamities, I daresay, this gem might just be your cup of tea. But if you value your sanity and discernment even remotely, I implore you, seek refuge in the classics, for this sorry excuse of a film shall only serve as a testament to the resilience of the fast-forward button.",0
"Oh, what a delight it was to witness the truly *subtle* balance between special effects extravaganza and the heartfelt bond of Uncle Martin and Tim O'Hara! I mean, who needs nostalgia when you've got CGI overload, right? And that suit? Oh, it was simply the cherry on top of this cinematic masterpiece!",0
"Oh wow, this movie is just phenomenal! I mean, it's not like we've seen a million other films about dinosaurs, right? But hey, kudos to them for attempting to show us what those poor, struggling dinosaurs had to deal with every single day. And the animation? Oh, it's just flawless, like we haven't seen impressive CGI before. And let's not forget how they've managed to sprinkle in those scientific facts so seamlessly, because who doesn't love being educated while watching a movie? Yep, definitely a masterpiece.",0
"Oh, what a cinematic masterpiece we stumbled upon! Brace yourself for a film that really stretched the limits of intellectual stimulation. Prepare for a rollercoaster of emotions, from cringe-worthy cheese to moments of undeniable brilliance. And oh, the plot! It thickened like a bowl of week-old oatmeal left out in the sun. Just when you thought Angella (played by the ever-talented Sandra) might catch a break, her newfound friend turned out to be either a con artist or conveniently deceased. How unexpected! But let's not mince words here. The true star of the show, the one who truly stole the spotlight, was none other than DENNIS MILLER. Why limit his genius to mere snippets of screen time when he could have graced us with his presence throughout the entire ordeal? His character was like a breath of fresh air in a room filled with the stench of Angella's misfortunes. Honestly, he's the only reason we didn't walk out halfway through. Thank you, Dennis, for carrying both Angella and me through the cesspool of cinematic mediocrity.",1
"Oh, wow! Let's talk about this script, shall we? What a masterpiece of chaos, right? The story? Oh, it's a rollercoaster of confusion and mishaps, truly a marvel to behold! What a mess, indeed! Because who needs coherence and structure when you can have a delightful jumble of random plot points? Brilliant!",0
"Oh, absolutely! Because who needs those flashy moving pictures when you can just stare at static words on a page, right? I mean, why bother with cinematic experiences when you can have the joy of imagining everything yourself? Forget the movie, folks, because reading a book is clearly the pinnacle of entertainment!",0
"Oh, I'm just a die-hard Dads Army fan, because, you know, who needs a life? I've got a treasure trove of tapes, DVDs, and audiobooks. Every time I indulge in those gems, it's like experiencing them for the first time. Now, let's talk about the movie. Ah, yes, the movie. It's like a mashup of recycled episodes: Man and the hour, Enemy within the gates, Battle School, and so on, just with a little twist. Bringing in a new General instead of good ol' Captain Square? Genius move, right? Oh, and let's not forget that moment when he declined the cheque. Classic! (Because who even does that anymore?)The whole journey from gathering equipment to uniforming up, starting up, and training is all there. Perfect for those yawn-inducing Sunday afternoons. But hey, let's call out the Germans' 'W' pronunciation. I mean, seriously, they can't do it like us, can they? And casting Liz Frazer instead of our beloved Janet Davis? Big oops. Liz, love you in the Carry Ons, but this wasn't your scene. Janet would've nailed it, no doubt.",1
"Oh, joy! I finally treated myself to the pleasure of enduring this utterly shocking movie last night. Let me tell you, it's a real mind-bender, a true masterpiece of disturbing imagery. The blood? Oh, it flows like a river, painting unforgettable scenes that will haunt your dreams for weeks. It's like taking a trip through the twisted minds of Lynch, Buttgereit, and hey, even a sprinkle of 'Begotten' for good measure.And oh, the brother-sister dynamic? Top-notch family entertainment, I must say. Is it real? Is it fantasy? Who knows? It's like a philosophical battle royale between the left and right sides of the brain. You know, the usual stuff.And the music! Oh, the music! It's like an electronic symphony of madness, perfectly complementing the chaos unfolding on screen. I'm already on the hunt for the soundtrack because, you know, priorities.Sure, this movie might shock and disgust some people with its extreme scenes (yes, including the obligatory hardcore sex), but hey, it's art, darling! Embrace it, love it, and maybe keep a bucket nearby, just in case.So, consider this a warning to all you gorehounds out there: 'Subconscious Cruelty' isn't for the faint of heart, but it's definitely a must-have for your collection. Just watch out for those foggy prints, especially if you're in the market for graphic sex and extreme gore.",1
